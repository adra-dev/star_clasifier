# Bootcamp DataScience
In this project I am going to simulate a real life scenario of a DataScience project step by step.
First we need define the project, since we already have information about the objective we can part from there by detailing parameters for the **SMART** goals

1. Specific
    - What needs to be accomplished?
        - build a star clasifier system
2. Mesurable
    - How do I mesure my model results?
        - Comparing the accuracy/roc result of diferent methods using Cross validation method.
3. Achivable
    - is your objective something your team can reasonably accomplish?
        - We need to review this point after gathering the data and making the EDA.
4. Relevant
    - Why are you setting the goal that youâ€™re setting?
        - For using the right model to achive the right clasification system.
5. Time-Bound
    - 22 days from 23/october/2023 to 14/november/2023
